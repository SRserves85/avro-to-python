==============

avro-to-python is a light tool for compiling avro schema files (.avsc) to python classes making using avro schemata easy.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://avro-to-python.readthedocs.io.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pip install (recommended)
-------------------------
To install avro-to-python, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install avro-to-python

Install From Source ()
----------------------

The sources for avro-to-python can be downloaded source as well.

Clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/srserves85/avro-to-python


Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:


.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install

or

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e .


Examples
^^^^^^^^

Majority of the use of avro-to-python is assumed to be used as a cli, but you can still import and use the python classes under the hood as well.

CLI (without --pip)
-------------------
To use the cli, here is the available cli commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    avro-to-python [source] [target]
        Options:
            --pip TEXT              make package pip installable using this name
            --top_level_package     override top level package name (optional)
            --author TEXT           author name of the pip installable package
            --package_version TEXT  version of the pip intallable package  [default: 0.1.0]
            --help                  Show this message and exit


The above will compile the avsc files and convert the to python classes found in [path_to_target_directory]

An example of doing this is the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    avro-to-python [path_to_source_avsc_files] [path_to_target_directory]


If you run the above on a valid avro avsc file, you should then be able to import them as you would in the avro idl namespace Here is an example of a single avsc record from the namespace: *name.space* and name: *RecordClass*:

.. code-block:: python

    from name.space import RecordClass

    record = RecordClass({'foo': True, 'bar': 'true', 'baz': 10, 'food': 'CHOCOLATE'})

Tips: To generate classes in a subpackage of your existing application set the "--top_level_package" flags to your subpackage name:

.. code-block:: bash

    avro-to-python [path_to_source_avsc_files] [path_to_my_subpackage_directory] --top_level_package my.subpackage

.. code-block:: python

    from my.subpackage.name.space import RecordClass

    record = RecordClass({'foo': True, 'bar': 'true', 'baz': 10, 'food': 'CHOCOLATE'})

CLI (with --pip)
----------------
You can also choose to make compiled avro packages ***pip installable*** by adding the "--pip" flags. An example of this is the following:
.. code-block:: bash

    avro-to-python [path_to_source_avsc_files] [path_to_target_directory] --pip test_avro

By running this, you should be able to pip install the above package you created from the target directory you specified by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e path_to_target_directory

Now that you have the package installed, you can import it by it's package name and namespace. Here is the same example of the same avsc from above, only with a pip package of *test_avro*:

.. code-block:: python

    from test_avro.name.space import RecordClass

    record = RecordClass({'foo': True, 'bar': 'true', 'baz': 10, 'food': 'CHOCOLATE'})

You can customize the top level package name *test_avro*, modifying the "--top_level_package" flags:

.. code-block:: bash

    avro-to-python [path_to_source_avsc_files] [path_to_target_directory] --pip test_avro --top_level_package event

.. code-block:: python

    from event.name.space import RecordClass

    record = RecordClass({'foo': True, 'bar': 'true', 'baz': 10, 'food': 'CHOCOLATE'})


avro-to-python in a Script
--------------------------
You can also use the reader and writer packages in avro-to-python as you would any other python package. Avro to python is split between a *reader* and *writer* classes. avro-to-python treates namespaces as acyclic trees and uses depth first search to ensure no duplication or namespace collisions on read and write. An example useage is below:

.. code-block:: python

    from avro_to_python.reader import AvscReader
    from avro_to_python.writer import AvroWriter

    # initialize the reader object
    reader = AvscReader(directory='tests/avsc/records/')

    # generate the acyclic tree object
    reader.read()

    # initialize the writer object
    writer = AvroWriter(reader.file_tree, pip='test_pip')

    # compile python files using 'tests/test_records as the namespace root'
    writer.write(root_dir='tests/test_records')



Roadmap
^^^^^^^

Reader

- [X] Create Namespace Trees on nested namespaces
- [X] Read Record and Enum File
- [X] Primitive types
- [X] Array Types
- [X] Union types
- [X] References to other files
- [X] Map Types
- [ ] Logical Types (Currently just converts to primitive types)

Writer

- [X] Base Schema Writer
- [X] Base Record Schema
- [X] Base Enum Schema
- [X] Primitive Types Schema
- [X] Array Types Schema
- [X] Union Types Schema
- [X] Map Types
- [ ] Logical Types Schema (Currently just converts to primitive types)
- [X] Add configs to pip install package

CLI

- [X] Wrap Writer and Reader into one cli commmit
- [X] Add pip install option (would include all files to pip install compiled package)
- [ ] Add better --help documentation

Documentation

- [ ] Document reader class
- [ ] Document writer class
- [ ] Document cli
